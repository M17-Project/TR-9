Important notes:
#1: Capacitor C47 on the mainboard is placed incorrectly in the schematic, so the silkscreen is also incorrectly showing its polarity. Please mount the capacitor the other way round with respect to the silkscreen (negative terminal to ground). //DONE
#2: Capacitors C76, C79 and C87 are marked as 50V, X7R type dielectric, when it should be 10V, X5R/X7R. //DONE
#3: All ferrite beads (including L1) are Fair-Rite 2506032217Y2. //DONE
#4: Volume pot is 50k/log Alps RK0971111Z32 with an SPST. //DONE
#5: All tact buttons on the side (including PTT) can be of the same type.
#6: D1 is green, D2 is red
#7: Pins 31 and 32 of STM32L011 (on the HMI board) should be soldered together. That's equivalent of forcing a low state on BOOT0.
#8: R64 should be 12k.
#9: Bypass C106 with a 10k resistor.
#10: Mainboard:R20 should be 470R
